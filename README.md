# task1: Robot Arm's Control panel.

I worked developing the Robot Arm control user interface to control the Robot Arm remotely. The development was done by HTML, CSS, and MySQL Database. The controlling the arm you need to select the value of each motor then save and run.  I used the HTML file to build the structure of the control panel page. By using CSS file I I design the style of the HTML file specifying the colors and hover of some element and where to set location each element in the page. Finally I create the database end table of motors values by PHPmyadmin.
